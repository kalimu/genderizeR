#' Getting gender prediction data for a given text vector.
#' 
#' \code{findGivenNames} extracts from text unique terms and predicts  
#' gender for them.
#' 
#' 
#' @param x A text vector or a character vector of unique terms 
#' pre-processed earlier manually or by the \code{textPrepare} function.
#' @param textPrepare If TRUE (default) the \code{textPrepare} function 
#' will be used on the \code{x} vector. Set it to FALSE if you already 
#' have prepared a character vector of cleaned up and deduplicated terms 
#' that you want to send to the API for gender checking.
#' @param country A character string with a country code for localized search
#' of names. Country codes follow the ISO_3166-1 alpha-2 standard
#' \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2}.
#' @param language A character string with a language code for localized search
#' of names. Language codes follow the ISO_639-1 standard: 
#' \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes}
#' @param apikey A character string with the API key obtained via 
#' \url{https://store.genderize.io}. A default is NULL, which uses the free API 
#'  plan. If you reached the limit of the API you can start from the last 
#'  checked term next time.
#' @param queryLength How much terms can be checked in a one single query.
#' @param progress If TRUE (default) progress bar is displayed in the console.
#' @param ssl.verifypeer Checks the SSL Certificate. Default is TRUE. 
#' You may set it to FALSE if you encounter some errors that break 
#' the connection with the API (though it is not recommended).
#'
#'
#' 
#' @return A data table with given names found in database, 
#' gender predictions,
#' probabilities of gender predictions, 
#' and counts how many people with a given name is recorded in the database.

#' x = "Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home 
#'      barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day's wood 
#'      and split the kindlings before supper-at least he was there in time 
#'      to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. 
#'      Tom's younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through 
#'      with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, 
#'      and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways. While Tom was eating his
#'      supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked 
#'      him questions that were full of guile, and very deep-for she wanted 
#'      to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many other simple-hearted
#'      souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent 
#'      for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her 
#'      most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.
