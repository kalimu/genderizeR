\title{Gender Prediction Based on First Names}
\description{
The \code{genderizeR} package uses genderize.io API to predict 
gender from first names extracted from text corpuses. The accuracy 
of prediction could be controlled by two parameters: 
counts of first names in database and probability of gender 
given the first name.
